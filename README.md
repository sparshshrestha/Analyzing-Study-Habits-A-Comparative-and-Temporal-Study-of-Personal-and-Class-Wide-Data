## Analyzing Study Habits: A Comparative and Temporal Study of Personal and Class-Wide Data

### Overview

This project analyzes study habits over a specific period by comparing personal study data with class-wide study patterns. Using R and R Markdown, we delve into temporal trends, identify correlations, and extract meaningful insights to understand how different study habits impact academic performance.

### Objectives

- **Personal Study Data Analysis**: Examine individual study patterns and their evolution over time.
- **Class-Wide Data Comparison**: Compare personal study habits with the broader class trends.
- **Temporal Trends**: Identify key periods and patterns in study behavior.
- **Correlations and Insights**: Uncover correlations between study habits and academic performance.

### Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: Data on personal and class-wide study habits over a defined period.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and cleaning the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand study patterns.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing individual data against class-wide trends.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Investigating how study habits change over time.
- **Conclusions**: Summarizing findings and insights derived from the analysis.

### Prerequisites

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio
- Required R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `readr`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/study-habits-analysis.git
   cd study-habits-analysis
   ```

2. **Install the necessary R packages**:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "lubridate", "readr"))
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the R Markdown file (`study_habits_analysis.Rmd`) in RStudio.
2. Run the code chunks sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
3. Adjust the parameters and visualizations as needed to explore different aspects of the data.
